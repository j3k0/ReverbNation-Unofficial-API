This project aims to provide a minimal set of methods to update a ReverbNation account from a remote website.

-----
USAGE
-----

It's a javascript driven API. Here are the basic commands available for now:

// Set Your ReverbNation User/Password (This call do not send the login request)
rnLogin(user, password);

// Set the Label ID. All subsequent actions  will act on this Label.
rnInitLabel(label_id);

// Change the status of active label or artist.
rnStatus(status_message);

// Set the Artist ID. All subsequent actions will act on this Artist.
rnInitArtist(artist_id);

// Add a show to active Artist. (datetime, venue_name, 
rnAddShow(datetime, venue_name, venue_city, venue_country);
>> example: rnAddShow('2010-10-04 20:30', 'Sky Bar', 'Beirut', 'LB');


See example.html for a full example.

INSIDE
------

reverbnation.js contains the javascript code, it depends on jQuery. Javascript makes asynchronous request to reverbnation.php to tell it which actions to perform.

reverbnation.php is a proxy, it gets orders from the Javascript Ajax call, and send them to ReverbNation in the appropriate format.
